Hello, this is Srijan here and want to give you an important notification.

All the textures will be saved in Textures folder.
Please make a sub-folder which name is the model you are texturing, for eg, if you are working on Garage model,
name it Garage then put your textures in it.

All the meshes will be saved in Mesh folder with name of the model as sub-folder.
